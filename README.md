# Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Patterns-Insights-and-Visualizations

#Project Description:
Project Overview: This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and user behavior using a dataset sourced from Kaggle titled "Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns." The dataset contains 1,320 samples of charging session data, capturing various metrics such as energy consumption, charging duration, vehicle details, and more. The analysis and visualizations offer insightful perspectives on EV usage and facilitate predictive modeling.

# Steps Involved:

1. Dataset Acquisition:
  - Downloaded the "Electric Vehicle Charging Patterns" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes metrics such as energy consumption, charging duration, and vehicle details for 1,320 charging sessions.

2. Setting Up the Environment:
  - Used Anaconda to launch Jupyter Notebook.
  - Utilized Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Loaded the dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
- Inspected the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Cleaned the dataset by removing null values and duplicates.
- Converted data columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime for dates, float for numerical values).
- Created new calculative columns such as total charging time, average charging rate, and energy consumption efficiency.

4. Data Visualization:
- Generated several visualizations to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset:
  * Bar Charts: Compared average energy consumed per vehicle model.
  * Line Charts: Analyzed the trend of average charging cost over days of the week.
  * Scatter Plots: Examined the relationship between battery capacity and energy consumed.
  * Pie Charts: Illustrated the proportion of different user types.
  * Histograms: Displayed the distribution of charging durations.
  * Box Plots: Showed the distribution and variability of charging costs.

5. Enhancing Visualizations:
- Improved visualizations by adding titles, axis labels, legends, annotations, and grid lines.
- Ensured readability and user-friendliness through consistent color schemes, readable font sizes, and informative tooltips.
